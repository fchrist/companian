Companian
=========

The Companian tool suite is a web application for

* documenting application frameworks according to the "Framework Description Meta-Model" (FDMM)
* running automatic framework compatibility analysis based on the FDMM documentation

Companian is a prototypical implementation of the ideas described in my Ph.D. thesis.
